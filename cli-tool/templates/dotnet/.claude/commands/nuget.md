# NuGet

Manage NuGet packages with security auditing and version management.

## Usage

Add a package to your project:

```bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
```

Check for vulnerable packages:

```bash
dotnet list package --vulnerable
```

## Implementation

I'll help you manage NuGet packages efficiently with security best practices. I can:

1. **Add, update, and remove packages** with appropriate versions
2. **Check for security vulnerabilities** in dependencies  
3. **Analyze package dependencies** and resolve conflicts
4. **Suggest package alternatives** and optimizations
5. **Set up centralized package management** for solutions

### Common Package Operations

**Add package with version:**
```bash
dotnet add package Serilog.AspNetCore --version 8.0.0
```

**Update packages:**
```bash
dotnet list package --outdated
dotnet update
```

**Remove package:**
```bash
dotnet remove package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.NewtonsoftJson
```

**Security audit:**
```bash
dotnet list package --vulnerable --include-transitive
```

**List all packages:**
```bash
dotnet list package --include-transitive
```

I'll analyze your current package configuration, identify security vulnerabilities, suggest package updates, and help optimize your dependency management strategy.
