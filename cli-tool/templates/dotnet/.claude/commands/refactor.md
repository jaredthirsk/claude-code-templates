# Refactor

Refactor .NET code with modern patterns and best practices.

## Usage

Refactor code to modern patterns:

```bash
# I'll analyze your code and suggest refactoring opportunities
```

## Implementation

I'll help you refactor your .NET code to follow modern patterns and best practices. I can:

1. **Analyze code structure** and identify refactoring opportunities
2. **Apply modern C# patterns** like records, pattern matching, and nullable reference types
3. **Implement SOLID principles** and clean architecture patterns
4. **Convert to async/await** patterns where appropriate
5. **Optimize performance** and memory usage
6. **Improve code readability** and maintainability

### Common Refactoring Scenarios

**Modernize C# code:**
- Convert classes to records where appropriate
- Use pattern matching and switch expressions
- Apply nullable reference types
- Implement primary constructors (.NET 8+)

**Architectural improvements:**
- Extract interfaces and implement dependency injection
- Apply repository pattern for data access
- Implement mediator pattern for CQRS
- Separate concerns into appropriate layers

**Performance optimizations:**
- Convert synchronous methods to async
- Implement proper memory management
- Optimize LINQ queries
- Add appropriate caching strategies

**Code quality improvements:**
- Apply consistent naming conventions
- Remove code duplication
- Simplify complex methods
- Add comprehensive error handling

I'll analyze your specific codebase and provide targeted refactoring recommendations with before/after examples.
